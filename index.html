					<h3>Entire Project</h3>
					<blockquote>
						<p>&ldquo;When we asked Ludwig to create a website for us, we were like many small business in that we were not fully aware of the likely input required from us, although we had a reasonable idea of the end result that we wanted. Ludwig took the time to understand our requirements, explained what would be required from us and then assisted us to come up with the required input. Ludwig also showed he was adaptable when we requested changes during the development process and we are extremely happy with both the end result and cost effectiveness of the total project.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>When Botany Downs Secondary College approached Web Creative to redesign their website, I jumped at the opportunity. I developed a comprehensive website for BDSC which allowed them to effectively communicate with their community, removing the need for physical newsletters. Parents are able to keep on top of the current events of the school and students are able to view photographs from school events with ease. The website is in constant development as the needs of the school changes.</p>
